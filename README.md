# Yoga Pose Classification System using Python and YOLO

## Overview
This repository contains a Yoga Pose Classification System developed using Python and the YOLO (You Only Look Once) model. The system is designed to recognize and classify various yoga poses from images or videos.

## Features
- **Real-time Pose Detection**: The YOLO model enables real-time detection of yoga poses, making it suitable for live video streams or recorded videos.
- **Accuracy**: The model achieves accurate classification results, allowing users to identify different asanas with confidence.
- **Customizable**: The system can be fine-tuned for specific yoga styles or individual poses by adjusting the training data and model parameters.

## Getting Started
1. **Installation**:
   - Install the required Python packages using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
   - Download the pre-trained YOLO weights (e.g., YOLOv3) from the official repository.

2. **Data Preparation**:
   - Collect a labeled dataset of yoga pose images.
   - Annotate the images with bounding boxes around each pose.
   - Organize the data into training and validation sets.

3. **Training the Model**:
   - Fine-tune the YOLO model on your annotated dataset.
   - Train the model using transfer learning or from scratch.
   - Monitor loss and accuracy during training.

4. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Evaluate the model's performance on the validation set.
   - Calculate metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score.
   - Adjust hyperparameters if necessary.

5. **Inference and Deployment**:
   - Use the trained model for inference on new images or videos.
   - Integrate the system into a web application, mobile app, or other platforms.

## Usage
1. **Training**:
   - Run the training script with appropriate arguments (e.g., paths to data, model configuration, and weights).
   - Monitor training progress and save checkpoints.

2. **Inference**:
   - Load the trained model weights.
   - Process input images or videos using YOLO for pose detection.
   - Classify detected poses based on the trained classifier.

3. **Visualization**:
   - Visualize the detected poses with bounding boxes and labels.
   - Display confidence scores for each pose.
